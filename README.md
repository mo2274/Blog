### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8.1

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/blog` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the server

From within the `/blog` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 9000
```

then open your browser and open:
http://127.0.0.1:9000/

and finally if you have any feedback it will be very welcomed.
